/**
 * First-run initialisation of the vault (`vault.ts`), including the ONE-TIME
 * migration out of `chrome.storage.local` for installs from before the vault.
 *
 * Before the vault the extension kept its identity keys (fleet-audit #253) and its
 * trust records, remote bridge targets and dismissed scope-update hashes
 * (#252) in `storage.local`, which every site's content script can read and
 * write. They now live in the vault; this module moves them there once.
 *
 * The rules that make this safe:
 *
 * - **storage.local is read only on an UNFORGEABLE upgrade signal.** An empty
 *   vault is not one: quota eviction, corruption or a wipe of the extension's
 *   IndexedDB empties it too, and if emptiness alone authorised the import, a
 *   renderer that had planted an identity (whose private key it knows) and
 *   trust records pinned to it would have both installed the next time the
 *   vault was lost. The signal is `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` with reason
 *   `update` arriving while the vault is still empty — Chrome fires it,
 *   nothing a page does can. It is deliberately NOT tied to a version number:
 *   whichever release first ships the vault, the one before it kept state in
 *   storage.local, and a hardcoded "last legacy version" would silently strand
 *   every user of a storage.local release cut after it was written (3.2.1 was
 *   one). What this admits beyond a genuine upgrade is a vault lost at the
 *   moment of an update — not something an attacker can schedule. An update
 *   onto a vault that already has an identity authorises nothing, so no
 *   authorisation lingers for a vault lost later. `noteInstalled` records it in
 *   `chrome.storage.session` (trusted contexts only), so a service worker
 *   killed mid-import retries from there, and the import CONSUMES it. With an
 *   empty vault and no signal, a fresh identity is minted and whatever sits
 *   under the legacy keys is deleted unread.
 * - **the service worker waits for the signal.** On an upgrade Chrome starts
 *   the new worker and only then dispatches onInstalled, so boot's first
 *   vault access can come first. Boot arms `armInstallSignal`; an empty vault
 *   waits (bounded) for onInstalled to say what happened before it decides.
 *   A normal wake never gets here — the vault already has an identity — so
 *   the wait costs only a worker that woke up to a lost vault.
 * - **the identity and everything imported with it land in ONE transaction**
 *   that first checks the identity is still absent (`vaultInitIfAbsent`),
 *   so the popup and the service worker cannot both initialise.
 * - **the stores are imported only alongside a legacy identity.** A trust
 *   record is meaningless without the identity it was pinned to.
 * - **everything imported is validated the way the live stores validate it**
 *   — malformed rows are dropped, never repaired into something trusted.
 *
 * What a migration cannot do is tell a legitimate legacy record from one a
 * content script planted BEFORE the upgrade — that storage was writable by
 * design until now. It imports what an existing user has, so no one has to
 * re-pair, and the exposure it closes is from the upgrade onward
 * (chrischall/fetchproxy docs/SECURITY.md §Defense 4).
 *
 * The identity is kept in whichever storage form this browser's IndexedDB
 * can hold (`identity-storage.ts`): probed here, only when minting or
 * importing, and every identity check below is on the STORED shape — a
 * Safari record is not an `ExtensionIdentity` until it is unwrapped, and
 * `null` (what a WebKit vault written before those forms existed holds) is
 * no identity at all, so it is overwritten rather than mistaken for one.
 *
 * Memoised per IndexedDB factory (= per profile) so the many callers that
 * need the vault ready — identity load, trust store, remote targets, popup —
 * share one run. A failed run is not memoised; the next caller retries.
