/**
 * The extension's vault: a small key/value store in the EXTENSION ORIGIN's
 * IndexedDB, for everything a content script must not be able to read or
 * write.
 *
 * Why not `chrome.storage.local`: the extension injects content scripts into
 * every site, and content scripts can read AND write `storage.local`. A
 * renderer compromise on any site therefore reaches everything stored there.
 * IndexedDB is origin-scoped, and a content script runs in the PAGE's origin —
 * its `indexedDB` is the site's, never `chrome-extension://<id>`'s — so the
 * vault is reachable only from the service worker and extension pages (the
 * popup). No manifest permission is involved: IndexedDB is a web platform API.
 *
 * What lives here (keys of the single `kv` object store):
 * - `identity`             — the extension's long-term keypairs, private halves
 *                            as NON-EXTRACTABLE `CryptoKey`s
 *                            (`identity-keys.ts`, fleet-audit #253) — or, where
 *                            the browser's IndexedDB cannot hold an X25519
 *                            `CryptoKey` (Safari), that one key sealed another
 *                            way (`identity-storage.ts`);
 * - `identityWrappingKey`  — the non-extractable AES-GCM key an identity in the
 *                            `wrapped` form is sealed under (Safari only);
 * - `trustedMcps`          — the MCP trust records (`trust-store.ts`);
 * - `remoteBridges`        — configured remote bridge targets;
 * - `dismissedScopeHashes` — scope-update offers the user said "keep as is" to
 *                            (`vault-records.ts`; these three are fleet-audit
 *                            #252 — a content script could forge or revoke
 *                            them while they lived in `storage.local`);
 * - `legacyStoresMigrated` — marker: the one-time import of those three out of
 *                            `storage.local` has happened (`vault-migration.ts`);
 * - `storageProbe:<uuid>`  — transient: a throwaway key `identity-storage.ts`
 *                            round-trips to learn what this IndexedDB can hold,
 *                            deleted as soon as it is read back.
 *
 * Every value is stored by structured clone, which is what lets a
 * non-extractable `CryptoKey` persist without its bytes ever being exposed.
 *
 * The factory is read from `globalThis.indexedDB` at call time, not captured
 * at import, so tests can hand each case a fresh in-memory profile.
