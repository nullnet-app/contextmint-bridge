/**
 * `sendInner` — seal one inner frame for an established MCP session and
 * write it to the host socket. Moved verbatim out of `background.ts`.
 *
 * This lives in its own module, depending on nothing but `state.ts`, so the
 * transport (`socket.ts`) and the request handlers can both reach it without
 * the handlers importing the socket: handlers → send-inner is a downward
 * edge, where handlers → socket would have closed a cycle back through the
 * frame dispatch.
 *
 * Crypto-critical: `entry.nextOutboundSeq()` advances the per-session AEAD
 * counter, and that counter is authenticated input to `sealInnerFrame`. The
 * number of invocations and the single-instance-ness of `SessionKeys` are
 * both load-bearing, so this must stay the one and only sender.
 *
 * Being the one and only sender is also why the wire-size cap lives here: it
 * is the single point every verb's answer passes through, so one check binds
 * `fetch` — whose body cap counts UTF-16 code units rather than bytes, and so
 * bounds nothing on the wire — and equally `read_indexed_db`,
 * `read_local_storage`, `read_session_storage` and `read_dom`, none of which
 * has a size cap of its own at all.
 *
 * The socket is now looked up rather than global: a sealed frame goes out on
 * the link this `mcpId`'s hello arrived on, and on no other. An id bound to no
 * link is not sendable — that is a session whose link dropped between the
 * request arriving and the answer being ready, and writing it to whichever
 * socket happened to be open would hand another bridge a response it never
 * asked for.

/**
 * What to send in place of a frame that will not fit.
 *
 * `ws` answers a payload over its `maxPayload` by CLOSING the connection with
 * 1009, and on the concentrator the extension holds ONE connection for every
 * MCP on the host — so letting an oversize frame go would take every sibling
 * MCP's bridge down in order to report that one request's answer was too big.
 * The refusal therefore happens here, while the frame still has a request id
 * to attach it to: that one call fails with a reason it can act on, the
 * socket is untouched, and no other MCP on it notices.
 *
 * Only a `response` can realistically be oversize (a `ping`/`pong` is a few
 * bytes), and only a response carries an id to answer. Anything else returns
 * null and is dropped with the log line — the same outcome an unsendable
 * frame already had.
