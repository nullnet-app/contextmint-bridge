// VENDORED — do not edit.

// Copied verbatim from chrischall/fetchproxy
// `packages/server/tests/cross-version/v3-fixtures.ts` (at 423c765, release
// 3.2.2) when the extension moved to this repo. It is a frozen recording of
// protocol-3 wire frames; everything below this header is byte-for-byte the
// upstream file. References below to `v3-fixtures.test.ts` and "this
// repository" mean the upstream fetchproxy repo, where the freeze itself is
// pinned. If the corpus ever changes, it changes there first and is re-copied
// here whole — never edited in place.

/**
 * FROZEN protocol-v3 wire frames.
 * **Never regenerate these from the current source.**
 *
 * They were captured ONCE, on 2026-09-12, from the PUBLISHED
 * `@fetchproxy/protocol@2.11.3` and `@fetchproxy/server@2.11.3` installed from
 * npm into a throwaway directory — `buildServerHello` built the server hello,
 * `readySignaturePayload` + `ed25519Sign` produced the ready signature, and
 * v3's own `sealInnerFrame` (the one whose `aesGcmSeal` call passes no
 * additional data at all) produced the encrypted frame. Nothing below was
 * produced by anything in this repository.
 *
 * That is the whole point of the file, and it is not a stylistic preference.
 * A "v3 fixture" hand-built from today's `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, today's
 * `helloSignaturePayload` or today's `sealInnerFrame` is not a v3 fixture: it
 * is a tautology that keeps passing however far v4 drifts, because it drifts
 * with it. #222's own report records the shape of that failure from the other
 * side — 128 tests failed on the 2→3 break precisely BECAUSE the suite's
 * fixtures hand-built the old version, and each had to be moved onto the
 * shared payload function. This file is the deliberate opposite: one corpus
 * that is allowed to keep saying 3 forever, so a v4 end can be held to a real
 * v3 peer rather than to this repo's memory of one.
 *
 * `v3-fixtures.test.ts` beside this file pins the freeze itself: it asserts
 * these frames say 3 where this source says 4, that today's validator refuses
 * every one of them, that the ciphertext really does open with no AAD under
 * the recorded key, and — the check that makes "never regenerated" a property
 * rather than a comment — that this module's SOURCE contains no import at all.
 * An import is how the current `PROTOCOL_VERSION` would get in here.
 *
 * Adding to the corpus later: capture from a published tarball of the version
 * you are freezing, the same way, and paste the result. Do not touch what is
 * already here — a frozen byte that moves has stopped being evidence.
 *
 * The interfaces below are local and deliberately NOT the ones in
 * `@fetchproxy/protocol`: those describe v4, so typing a v3 frame with them
 * would either fail to compile or drag the fixture toward the current shape
 * on the next field the protocol gains.
