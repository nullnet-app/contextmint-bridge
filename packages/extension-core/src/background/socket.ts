/**
 * The bridge transport: the loopback link, plus zero-or-more configured
 * remote links, held open together.
 *
 * Before remote targets this module held ONE socket in `state.ws` and one
 * per-connection nonce in `state.currentExtSessionNonce`. Both are now
 * per-link (`links.ts`), and that is the substance of the change rather than
 * a refactor: the ready signature commits to the nonce of the connection its
 * hello arrived on, so a global nonce would sign one link's ready with
 * another link's handshake and the MCP would correctly reject it.
 *
 * What did NOT change, and must not:
 *
 * - **`connect` is still the keepalive's `ensureConnected`** — no parameters,
 *   idempotent, safe to call on every alarm tick. It now ensures EVERY link
 *   rather than one, and the `readyState` short-circuit still turns a tick
 *   into a no-op per link.
 * - **the loopback link is unconditional.** Remote targets are additional; no
 *   configuration removes or redirects `ws://127.0.0.1:37149`.
 * - **frames route DOWN** — `onEncryptedFrame` → `handlers/dispatch.ts`, and
 *   handlers reply through `send-inner.ts` rather than back through here.
 *
 * The one new refusal: a frame is dropped unless its `mcpId` is bound to the
 * link it arrived on. Decryption would fail anyway (the session key is
 * per-MCP and this extension holds a different one for the other link's
 * session), but "the id is not yours" is a routing answer and belongs before
 * the crypto rather than behind it.

 * A v3 MCP meeting this v4 extension (Task 4.1).

 * frame was dropped with a `console.warn` in a service worker nobody has open,
 * and the MCP then waited out its 30-second `SESSION_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` before
 * reporting `not-ready` with a hint blaming a signed-out session or a changed
 * scope. A hang is the worst failure mode a version mismatch can have — the
 * person seeing it has nothing to act on and no reason to suspect a version —
 * and on a hosted relay, across a fleet whose pins move on a nightly cron,
 * that is the shape a v4 rollout would otherwise take.
 *
 * `hello-rejected` is the vehicle because it PREDATES the break: it landed in
 * 2.6.0, the cohort declares `accepts: ['hello-rejected']`, and the frame
 * carries no authority — a forged one can make a session fail, which a silent
 * peer could do anyway by never answering. So a v3 MCP needs no change at all
 * to hear this; only this side does.
 *
 * It GRANTS NOTHING, which is the contract `peekHelloVersion` is written to
 * and the reason this lives in the catch rather than anywhere a session could
 * be started from: no binding, no trust read or write, no counter, no session.
 * Every field it reads came out of a frame no validator accepted, so the
 * `mcpId` is used only to address the answer back down the socket it arrived
 * on and the `accepts` list only to decide whether to speak at all.
 *
 * Returns whether it answered FOR the mismatch — false leaves the caller on
 * the pre-existing silent-drop path, so the version mismatch is the only case
